       <h2><center><u>WHAT A COLLEGE IS</u></center></h2>
       <pre><font size="10">A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding <br>tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational education,<br> a further education institution, or a secondary school.<br>

        In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a training institution <br>that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university status (often without its own<br> degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs<br> either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university  or it may be a residential<br> college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide <br>affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees.<br></pre></font>
